# Multiclass Job Category Classification Using Support Vector Machine Algorithm
This project uses a dataset scraped from the job portal Tech in Asia. After data cleaning and type adjustments, seven columns were selected for analysis: Job ID, Label Category, Name, Company, Location, Salary, and Skills. Name and Skills were used as inputs and Label Category as the output to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel using the one-vs-rest approach. The model achieved an accuracy of 88.89%, weighted precision of 88.87%, weighted recall of 88.89%, and weighted F1-score of 88.32%, demonstrating effective job category prediction. The modeling process, from dataset preparation to model evaluation, was implemented in Python. Additionally, the results were visualized in an interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio.
